<u><h1> FOREST </h1></u>
<h3>
  <p> A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.<br>
 Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating
 factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and
 ecological function.<br>
 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization definition, a forest is defined as
 land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover
 of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ.<br>
  It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.
